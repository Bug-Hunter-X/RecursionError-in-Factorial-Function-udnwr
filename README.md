# RecursionError in Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: forgetting to handle the base case correctly or not having a proper base case. The `factorial` function is implemented recursively. When called with a negative number, the recursion goes on infinitely, causing a `RecursionError`. The solution demonstrates how to handle negative inputs gracefully.
